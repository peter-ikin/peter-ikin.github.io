# Git

Brew install git ( this installs the latest version of git )
Then check version number with
Git --version 
If it has the following (git version 2.11.0 (Apple Git-81)) then the shell is still using the original one.
Try restarting your terminal and try again.
If not try looking at /etc/paths
And checking that /usr/local/bin appears before /usr/bin
