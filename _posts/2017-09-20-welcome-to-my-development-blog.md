## About Me
Hello, my name is Peter and I'm a software engineer based in the UK. 

My first computer was the [Amstrad CPC6128][cpc-link] where I wrote[^1] *extremely* linear text adventure games with glorious 
ASCII art. I moved onto an Amiga where I played with programming in [AMOS][AMOS] and discovered the power of the for loop. The
rest, as they say, is history. I have been programming on and off since then and have done so professionally for well over a decade.

## Why am I writing this blog?
For one I want to share my love of technology and specifically programming. I have worked with many different technologies and platforms
over the years and want to try and share some of the things I have learned along the way. I am planning to write short, tips and tricks, style posts
alongside longer, more in depth tutorial series on various different technologies.


Also no opening blog post on a programming related site would be complete without the obligatory ...

{% highlight js %}
function hello() {
    console.log("hello world!")
}
hello();
{% endhighlight %}

[AMOS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)

[^1]:I should say *attempted* to write really, I was only 9, the games were not very good...
